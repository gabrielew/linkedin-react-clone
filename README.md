Clone of the Linkedin web application developed with [Rocketseat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJVp_vlvMwQ).

## Features

This front-end features the latest tools and practices in web development!

- âš› **React** â€” A library to build web applications
- ðŸ’… **CSS** â€” styled-components

I've used other libraries too, like **storybook** to preview pages before implementing.

## Getting started

First you need to have `node` or `yarn` installed on your machine. Then, you can clone this repository and run the following commands inside the project folder:

1. `yarn start` or `npm install`;
